From a command line Run "DigiRGBMail EMAILADDRESS"
Where EMAILADDRESS is the desired email address @mailinator.com you'd like it to check.
Send an email to that address with a color name (css3 colors) or R G and B values (seperated with spaces) as the subject, the light will change to that color.

Uses DigiRGB to actually change the color

Enjoy!
